<span><b>2	HOW THE CONTRACT IS FORMED BETWEEN YOU AND US</b> </span>

<p>2.1	We contract with retailers worldwide, so as to make such retailer's merchandise available in your country. In doing this we can provide 
you with landed cost visibility in multiple currencies on transactions involving such retailer's merchandise. </p>



<p>2.2	By placing an order with us through our site, you acknowledge that your transaction will be with us and not with the respective retailer. 
You further acknowledge that upon successful verification by us of the authenticity and sufficiency of the information you provide, we will then 
purchase the merchandise from the respective retailer for the sole purpose of immediately reselling it to you for the amounts presented and 
agreed-upon when you submitted your order. We will be responsible for fulfilling the order to you. </p>

<p>2.3	Our site will guide you through the steps you need to take to place an order and make a payment with us. Our order process allows 
you to check and amend any errors before submitting your order to us. Please take the time to read and check your order at each page of the order process. </p>

<p>2.4	After you place an order, you will receive an e-mail from us acknowledging that we have received your order. The Contract between 
us will only be formed when you receive your order confirmation email. </p>

<p>2.5	We will send you an e-mail that confirms that the Products have been dispatched ("Dispatch Confirmation").</p> 

<p>2.6	If we are unable to supply you with a Product, for example because that Product is not in stock or no longer available or because 
of an error in the price on our site or the respective retailer’s site, we will inform you of this by e-mail and we will not process your order. 
If you have already paid for the Products, we will refund you the full amount including any delivery costs charged as soon as possible and will 
incur no further liability to you. </p>

<p>2.7	You acknowledge that we shall be permitted to verify the authenticity and sufficiency of the information you provide, and if we are unable
 to verify the information automatically, our representatives may contact you and/or your debit or credit card issuing bank to confirm your identity 
 and/or your intent to place the order. </p>

<p>2.8	Please note that any Products made available through our site are intended for noncommercial use, and purchase of any Products for resale 
purposes is strictly prohibited. </p>

<p>2.9	By placing an order or making a payment through our site, you warrant that you are legally capable of entering into binding contracts. 
Your credit/debit card or other payment method will be billed by us and charges on your statement will be accompanied by the description "NightCoders", 
“eSW”, or similar. You warrant that all the information provided to us for the purpose of processing payments is correct and you are authorized to utilize 
the proffered payment method. You acknowledge that we will be entitled to verify the authenticity and sufficiency of the payment information you provide. </p>

<p>2.10	You acknowledge and agree that we shall conduct pre-payment screening on you and the information you have provided. These checks are designed to 
prevent NightCoders from conducting business with a sanctioned individual, entity or country in violation of any applicable laws and regulatory requirements 
in the territories we operate (including without limitation all customs laws and regulations and export and import controls administered by the 
    U.S. government (including, but not limited to, the Export Administration Regulations under the U.S. Department of Commerce), the European Union 
    and any other applicable jurisdiction). </p>

<p>2.11	We provide the service of determining the appropriate taxes and duties to be applied to the importation of the Product by you, and to collect,
 report and remit these taxes and duties, as applicable, on your behalf, to the appropriate tax authority. For imports into the European Union and 
 the United Kingdom, the resulting taxes and duties are included in your payment and are paid by NightCoders and there are no additional costs. 
 By accepting these Terms, you authorise NightCoders to accept any additional claims for levies (additional assessment) from the relevant customs 
 authorities. For certain non-European imports, you will be responsible for the remittance of taxes and duties to the appropriate tax authority. 
 All Products purchased from us are made pursuant to a shipment contract. Title to the Products shall transfer from the relevant retailer to 
 NightCoders after exportation of the Products. Title subsequently transfers from NightCoders to you prior to importation of the Product and 
 you shall be the importer of record (save for delivery to Switzerland, where NightCoders will be the importer of record). Risk of loss in the 
 Product passes to you when the Product is delivered to you. </p>

<p>2.12	By ordering Products from us, you hereby authorize a licensed customs broker chosen by us to act as your agent and transact business with 
foreign revenue authorities to clear your Products, account for duties and taxes on your behalf, if applicable return your Products and if 
applicable, prepare and submit refund claims on your behalf for any merchandise that you return. Please note that this section 2.12 excludes 
customers in Canada; customers in Canada should refer to section 6.10. </p>

<p>2.13	The price of your order will be quoted including or excluding taxes depending on the delivery address: (a) Products delivered within 
Canada will be quoted exclusive of sales tax; and (b) Products delivered within Europe will be quoted inclusive of value added tax. Shipping 
costs are not included in the price; these will be added at the checkout and will be indicated as a separate charge on your order form (except, 
    in circumstances where free shipping is offered). </p>

<p>2.14	For consumers in Australia, by placing an order with us through our site, you acknowledge that you are entering into an 
international transaction with us and not with the respective retailer. Further, you acknowledge that some banks may charge an international 
transaction fee according to their policies. We do not charge this fee or control when your bank will charge it. </p>
